Working With Loops | Lesson 4
Practice: Password Validator
Instructions
Suppose you are building a simple password validator for a website. Let’s use what
we have learned about loops to verify the password.
Task
Write a program to prompt the user for a password. The password should meet all
these requirements:
● The password must be at least 8 characters long.
● The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
● The password must contain at least one number.

● If the password does not meet all the requirements, the program should
keep asking the user for a new password until they provide a valid one.
Your application should:

● Use readlineSync.question() to prompt a user for input.
● Prompt a user to enter a password.
● Loop through the password to ensure that it meets the password
requirements, using the appropriate iteration statement(s) to do so. Make
sure you consider how iteration affectts top-to-bottom execution of your code
and when a while or do-while loop would be more appropriate.
● Return one of the following statements:
○ If the password meets the requirements, a statement to let the user
know they have been successful
○ If the password does NOT meet the requirements, a statement to let
the user know their password does not meet the requirements

Setup

1. Make sure you install readline-sync following the instructions in the
   Lesson: Values, Data Types, and Operations - 4.
2. For this activity, you will create your own repository to store your code:
3. Create a new repository.
4. Name it: practice-password-validator-[Your First Name]-[Your Last
   Initial]
5. Make sure the repository is public.
6. Clone the repository to your local machine.
7. Start working on the code.
